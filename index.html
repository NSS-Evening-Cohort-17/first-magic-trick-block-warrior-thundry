        <p>Hypnotic is an alcoholic beverage. It is native to New York, but bottled in France by Heaven Hill Distilleries, made from fruit juices, vodka and cognac.
             It is 34 proof and is available in over 70 countries. Hypnotic was created in 2001 by Raphael Yakoby, a college dropout living with his parents on Long Island, New York. 
             After seeing a blue perfume at Bloomingdale's, he decided to create a blue liqueur.
            Nick Storm, a Yonkers, N.Y., native, partnered with Yakoby to promote it. Yakoby and Storm failed to sell the concept to major beverage manufacturers. 
            They then promoted the drink in clubs and bars through a series of promotional events and parties that worked Storm's music industry contacts.
            The big break came when hip-hop impresario Sean "Diddy" Combs agreed to sell the drink in his restaurant chain Justin's in New York.

        <p>Urban and hip-hop groups began to promote the brand in music videos, on stage, and in rap lyrics from Kanye West, Ludacris, Missy Elliot, Jay-Z, Lil’ Kim, Fabolous and Diddy.
            Fabolous was instrumental in their success. He mentioned it in at least four songs on his album, Street Dreams.
            On his 2002 hit single "This Is My Party", Fabolous started his first verse with:"Ain't no tellin' what this Hpno' will do to me."
             A cocktail called "Incredible Hulk", whose color was reminiscent of the comic book hero, was made at Combs' Justin's restaurants.

        <p>The brand was originally distributed by Wingard Inc. of Great Neck, New York; in January 2003, Yakoby's trademark and the distribution rights were acquired by Heaven Hill Distilleries.
            The brand earned Yakoby a reported $50 million. Hypnotic is bottled in France's Cognac region and made with cognac and triple-distilled French vodka.
            It is the fourth best-selling imported liqueur in the United States, according to Adams Beverage Media. Hypnotic also produces "Harmonie", which is purple.

  <h4>Overview of Gin</h4>
  <section> 
      Gin /ˈdʒɪn/ is a distilled alcoholic drink that derives its predominant flavour from juniper berries (Juniperus communis). Gin originated as a medicinal liquor made by monks and alchemists across Europe, particularly in southern France, Flanders and the Netherlands, to provide aqua vita from distillates of grapes and grains. 
      It then became an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin emerged in England after the introduction of the jenever, a Dutch and Belgian liquor that was originally a medicine. Although this development had been taking place since the early 17th century, gin became widespread after the William of Orange-led 1688 Glorious Revolution and subsequent import restrictions on French brandy. 
      Gin today is produced in different ways from a wide range of herbal ingredients, giving rise to a number of distinct styles and brands. After juniper, gin tends to be flavoured with botanical/herbal, spice, floral or fruit flavours or often a combination. It is commonly consumed mixed with tonic water in a gin and tonic.
