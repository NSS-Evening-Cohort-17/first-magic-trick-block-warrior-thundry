    <p class="Blue_Hypnotic_Text">Hypnotic is an alcoholic beverage. It is native to New York, but bottled in France by Heaven Hill Distilleries, made from fruit juices, vodka and cognac.
         It is 34 proof and is available in over 70 countries. Hypnotic was created in 2001 by Raphael Yakoby, a college dropout living with his parents on Long Island, New York. 
         After seeing a blue perfume at Bloomingdale's, he decided to create a blue liqueur.
        Nick Storm, a Yonkers, N.Y., native, partnered with Yakoby to promote it. Yakoby and Storm failed to sell the concept to major beverage manufacturers. 
        They then promoted the drink in clubs and bars through a series of promotional events and parties that worked Storm's music industry contacts.
        The big break came when hip-hop impresario Sean "Diddy" Combs agreed to sell the drink in his restaurant chain Justin's in New York.

        <p class="Green_Hypnotic_Text">Urban and hip-hop groups began to promote the brand in music videos, on stage, and in rap lyrics from Kanye West, Ludacris, Missy Elliot, Jay-Z, Lilâ€™ Kim, Fabolous and Diddy.
            Fabolous was instrumental in their success. He mentioned it in at least four songs on his album, Street Dreams.
            On his 2002 hit single "This Is My Party", Fabolous started his first verse with:"Ain't no tellin' what this Hpno' will do to me."
             A cocktail called "Incredible Hulk", whose color was reminiscent of the comic book hero, was made at Combs' Justin's restaurants.

        <p class="Purple_Hypnotic_Text">The brand was originally distributed by Wingard Inc. of Great Neck, New York; in January 2003, Yakoby's trademark and the distribution rights were acquired by Heaven Hill Distilleries.
            The brand earned Yakoby a reported $50 million. Hypnotic is bottled in France's Cognac region and made with cognac and triple-distilled French vodka.
            It is the fourth best-selling imported liqueur in the United States, according to Adams Beverage Media. Hypnotic also produces "Harmonie", which is purple.
