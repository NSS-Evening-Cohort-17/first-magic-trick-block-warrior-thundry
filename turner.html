                <h4>Overview of Gin</h4>
                <p> Gin originated as a medicinal liquor made by monks and alchemists across Europe,
                particularly in southern France, Flanders and the Netherlands, to provide aqua vita from distillates
                of grapes and grains. </p>

    <detail-text>Gin /ˈdʒɪn/ is a distilled alcoholic drink that derives its predominant flavour from juniper berries

                <h4>Gin Today</h4>
                <p>It then became an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin today is produced
                    in different ways from a wide range of herbal ingredients, giving rise to a number of distinct
                    styles
                    and brands. After juniper, gin tends to be flavoured with botanical/herbal, spice, floral or fruit
                    flavours or often a combination.
                    It is commonly consumed mixed with tonic water in a gin and tonic. </p>

                <h4>Origins</h4>
                <p>Gin emerged in England after the introduction of the jenever, a Dutch and Belgian liquor that was
                    originally a medicine.
                    Although this development had been taking place since the early 17th century, gin became widespread
                    after the William of Orange-led 1688 Glorious Revolution and subsequent import restrictions on
                    French
                    brandy. </p>
